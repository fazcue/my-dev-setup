# When writing code, you MUST follow these principles:
- Code should be easy to read and understand.
- Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal
  intent.
- Functions should be small and do one thing well. They should not exceed a few
  lines.
- Function names should describe the action being performed.
- Prefer fewer arguments in functions. Ideally, aim for no more than two or
  three.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive
  to make the code self-explanatory.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily
  apparent from the code itself.
- Properly handle errors and exceptions to ensure the software's robustness.
- Use exceptions rather than error codes for handling errors.
- Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices
  to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.
- Adhere to these 4 principles of Functional Programming:
  1. Pure Functions
  2. Immutability
  3. Function Composition
  4. Declarative Code
- Do not use object oriented programming.
